        <h2>Notes on Teen Movies Evidence</h2>
        <h1 class="maintext">
            Movies about teens are extremely dramatic and over emphasize highschool stereotypes.
            These movies show different classes of people, and these different classes were created
            because of pop culture, so pop culture made different social levels.
        </h1>
        <h1 class="maintext">
            Movies in teen movies show that even the kids who have everything still experience pain
            because of the poisonous system of status snobbery and exclusion. Gangsters in high school
            movies are shown as modern urban people.

            These are the heroes of the teen movies, the third in the trio of character types.
