        <h2>My Opinions on Pop Culture</h2>
        <h1 class="maintext">
            I think that popculture has replaced culture but that is not a bad thing.
            Poculture works for all type of people, and many new ideas have emerged because of
            pop culture. 
        </h1>
        <h1 class="maintext">
            Pop culture has definately influenced my life, but I do think it is more important to think
            about how your actions effect your friends and family rather than how pop culture views
            your choices.
