        <h1 class="maintext">
            The affluence of despair is about how the media and news channels
             always talk about bad things and interupt peoples' time to grief
              in order to make more money for themselves. This changed society 
              by broadcasting private events, and this is a result of pop culture.

            TV workers are not high class thinkers. Everytime you turn on the TV
            to watch the new you see stories about horrible things such as rape
            murder and sucide. A particular quote from this artical stood out to me.
